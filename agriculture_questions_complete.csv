What are the subtypes of subsistence farming?,Subsistence farming includes intensive subsistence farming and primitive subsistence farming.
What is intensive subsistence farming?,Intensive subsistence farming is a type of farming where farmers cultivate small plots of land using simple tools and labor-intensive methods. It is common in densely populated monsoon regions of Asia.
What is nomadic herding?,"Nomadic herding is a farming practice where herdsmen move with their animals in search of water and pasture, typically in arid regions."
What is commercial farming?,"Commercial farming is large-scale agriculture where crops and livestock are produced for sale in the market, often using mechanized techniques."
What are the types of commercial farming?,"The types of commercial farming include commercial grain farming, mixed farming, and plantation farming."
What is commercial grain farming?,"Commercial grain farming involves growing grains such as wheat and maize for sale. It is practiced in temperate grasslands of North America, Europe, and Asia."
What is mixed farming?,Mixed farming is a type of farming where both crops and livestock are raised together on the same land.
What is organic farming?,Organic farming is an agricultural method that uses organic manure and natural pesticides instead of chemicals. No genetic modification is done.
What is horticulture?,"Horticulture refers to the cultivation of fruits, vegetables, and flowers for commercial use."
What is viticulture?,"Viticulture is the cultivation of grapes, primarily for wine production."
What is sericulture?,Sericulture is the commercial rearing of silkworms for silk production.
What is pisciculture?,Pisciculture is the breeding of fish in specially constructed tanks or ponds.
What is jute known as?,Jute is known as the 'Golden Fibre'.
Which country is the leading producer of coffee?,"Brazil is the leading producer of coffee, followed by Colombia and India."
Which factors are necessary for rice cultivation?,"Rice requires high temperature, high humidity, and heavy rainfall. It grows best in alluvial clayey soil that retains water."
Which factors are necessary for wheat cultivation?,"Wheat requires moderate temperature, moderate rainfall, and bright sunshine at the time of harvest. It grows best in well-drained loamy soil."
What are millets?,Millets are coarse grains that can grow on less fertile and sandy soils. They need low rainfall and moderate temperatures.
Which countries grow maize?,"Maize is grown in North America, Brazil, China, Russia, Canada, India, and Mexico."
What conditions does cotton require for growth?,"Cotton requires high temperature, light rainfall, 210 frost-free days, and bright sunshine. It grows best on black and alluvial soils."
What is food security?,"Food security exists when all people have access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food at all times to maintain a healthy life."
Why is tea grown on plantations?,"Tea requires a cool climate, high rainfall, and well-drained loamy soil with gentle slopes. Large amounts of labor are needed to pick the leaves, making it suitable for plantations."
How does farming in India differ from farming in the USA?,"In India, farms are small (about 1.5 hectares), and traditional methods are often used. In the USA, farms are large (about 250-300 hectares), highly mechanized, and follow scientific practices."
What is the farm system?,"The farm system includes inputs (seeds, fertilizers, machinery, labor), processes (ploughing, sowing, irrigation), and outputs (crops, wool, dairy, poultry)."
What is mechanization in agriculture?,"Mechanization in agriculture involves using machines such as tractors, seed drills, and harvesters to improve efficiency and productivity."
What are the differences between primary and tertiary activities?,"Primary activities involve extraction and production of natural resources (e.g., farming, fishing, mining). Tertiary activities provide services such as transport, banking, and trade."
What are the disadvantages of traditional farming methods?,"Disadvantages include lower productivity, higher labor intensity, vulnerability to weather changes, and lack of modern equipment."
Why do farmers in India face storage problems?,"Many farmers in India lack proper storage facilities, forcing them to sell their produce immediately, even at unfavorable prices."
What are the benefits of cooperative societies for farmers?,"Cooperative societies help farmers by providing loans, guidance on farming techniques, and facilities for marketing and storage of produce."

How do pesticides help in farming?,"Pesticides help protect crops from pests and diseases, increasing overall productivity."
What is the impact of climate on farming?,"Climate affects crop growth by determining temperature, rainfall, and sunlight availability. Extreme weather can damage crops."
How has technology changed modern farming?,"Technology has improved farming through mechanization, satellite monitoring, scientific soil testing, and efficient irrigation systems."
